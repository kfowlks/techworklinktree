# Tech Links Linktree

Just need static location to place all of my tech links with headings

## Getting started 
- fork this repo and clone it
- in the `index.html` file change: 
    - the metatags so that they link to your profile picutres, twitter page, etc.,
    - headers and links
- in the `styles.css` file change colors and whatever else your soul wishes
- deploy! I usually deploy such projects on [netlify](netlify.com) or [surge](surge.sh) because it takes very little time
