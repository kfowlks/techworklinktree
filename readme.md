# Tech Links Linktree

Just need static location to place all of my tech links with headings

## Getting started 
- fork this repo and clone it
- in the `index.html` file change: 
    - the metatags so that they link to your profile picutres, twitter page, etc.,
    - headers and links
- in the `styles.css` file change colors and whatever else your soul wishes

## Thanks
Special shoutout to [sylwia vargas](https://github.com/sylwiavargas/tech-writing-linktree) whose repo provided me with a template.

## Building Docker Image

- Exit to terminal, type `docker build -t fowlks-linktree .`
- deploy! By running docker in terminal `docker container run -d -p 5000:80 fowlks-linktree:latest`
